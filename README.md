## PYPI/HIGH SEAS DEMO LINK (READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT)
<p>The feedback AI at HighSeas told me that a lot of people got confused about what the demo link was, so I wrote this explanation, in case someone doesnt know.</p>
<p>Pypi is sort of like Github, but instead of uploading code, you upload a package.</p>
<p>Package contains everything needed to run a project (code, dependencies, etc.).</p>
<p>You can run the code inside the package by simply running an entry command, this command is different for every project.</p>
<p>To download the package, simply copy the command from the linked Pypi repo.</p>
<p>Link to Pypi repo also here: </p>
<p>The copy button is at the top of the page, see image bellow.</p>

<p>After the instalation is done, you can run the package by typing this command: </p>
<p>In case this explanation isnt clear to you, please write it to the HighSeas feedback AI(the why did you vote for x input bar) or write it to me directly through the contact on Slack link. Any feedback is appreciated!</p>
